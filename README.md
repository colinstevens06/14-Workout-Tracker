# 14-Workout-Tracker

This Workout Tracker allows a user to input data from their daily workouts so they can track their overall progress.

The idea is that you input different aspects of your workout, then over time you can see the results in different graphs and charts.

## Technology Used
We were given front-end code and were required to write code to connect to a NoSQL database.

### MongoDB
The focus of this project was MongoDB. I created the model used in the database, then wrote code for the routes. I used the seed file as my guide to writing the model. And I wrote the routes based off of methods used in the front-end's api.js file.

### SASS
I wanted to take the project a little further, so I converted all the provided CSS into SASS. I focused on segmenting the CSS into related chunks. Then, where possible, I used SASS's nesting to group code together.
